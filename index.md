My name is Vicente Olmedo and I'm passionate about technology in general and Software Engineering in particular.

I hold a PhD in Telecommunications Engineering. Telecommunications is a field of Electrical Engineering that combines
electronics and software engineering, along with radio-frequency and signal processing. They are then applied to the
creation of communication technologies, from mobile communications to computer networks and protocols.

Probably the most important motivation that has always fueled my career is curiosity. I love learning new things,
being at the edge of technology and even pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. I began learning programming
languages when I was 7 (BASIC on an Amstrad CPC 464, good memories :)) and I have been learning new things on my own
since then.

I'm currently a backend software engineer and I use [Go](https://golang.org/) to write microservices that run on
Kubernetes. I love distributed systems, designing for scalability and resiliency and craft beautiful APIs.

[Gophers slack channel](https://gophers.slack.com/) and the [Kubernetes slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/), feel
